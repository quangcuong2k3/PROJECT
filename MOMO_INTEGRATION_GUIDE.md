## 🔧 Current Issue: MoMo Test Environment

The error code 99 ("Unknown error") from MoMo test environment is common and typically indicates:

1. **Test credentials expired** - MoMo occasionally updates test credentials
2. **Test environment maintenance** - MoMo test servers may be temporarily unavailable
3. **Regional restrictions** - Test environment might have IP/region limitations

## 🚀 How to Resolve

### Option 1: Use Production Credentials (Recommended)
1. **Register with MoMo Business**: https://business.momo.vn/
2. **Get real credentials** for your business
3. **Update `.env` file** with your production credentials:
   ```env
   MOMO_PARTNER_CODE=your_real_partner_code
   MOMO_ACCESS_KEY=your_real_access_key
   MOMO_SECRET_KEY=your_real_secret_key
   ```

### Option 2: Contact MoMo Developer Support
- **Email**: developer@momo.vn
- **Request updated test credentials**
- **Mention you're getting error code 99 with test environment**

### Option 3: Test with Small Real Amount
- Use production credentials
- Test with minimum amount (1,000 VND ≈ $0.04 USD)
- This is often faster than waiting for test environment fixes

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### Local Testing (Works Now)
```bash
# Test server endpoints
node test-momo.js

# Test direct MoMo API
node test-simple-momo.js
```

### React Native App Testing
1. **Enable MoMo in app**: Payment method is already available
2. **Test payment flow**: Complete order → Select MoMo → App redirects to MoMo
3. **Test with real credentials**: Once you have them from MoMo Business

## 📱 MoMo App Integration

Your app already supports:
- **Deep Links**: `thecoffee://momo-success`
- **App-to-App**: Opens MoMo app directly
- **Web Fallback**: Opens MoMo web payment if app not installed
- **Return Handling**: Processes payment completion

## 🔒 Production Checklist

When you get real MoMo credentials:

- [ ] Update environment variables with real credentials
- [ ] Test with small amount (1,000 VND)
- [ ] Verify webhook URL is accessible from internet
- [ ] Test on real device with MoMo app installed
- [ ] Configure proper redirect URLs for your domain
- [ ] Set up proper error monitoring

## 📋 Environment Variables

```env
# Production MoMo Configuration
MOMO_PARTNER_CODE=your_partner_code_from_momo_business
MOMO_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_from_momo_business  
MOMO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_from_momo_business

# Test Configuration (if working)
# MOMO_PARTNER_CODE=MOMOBKUN20180529
# MOMO_ACCESS_KEY=klm05TvNBzhg7h7j
# MOMO_SECRET_KEY=at67qH6mk8w5Y1nAyMoYKMWACiEi2bsa
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **For Production**: Register with MoMo Business to get real credentials
2. **For Testing**: Contact MoMo support for updated test credentials
3. **For Demo**: Your integration is complete - just explain the test env issue

## 💡 Alternative for Demo

If you need to demo the app immediately:
1. **Use Cash on Delivery**: This payment method works perfectly
2. **Use Stripe**: International payments work fine
3. **Mock MoMo**: Show the MoMo flow until the payment redirect

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Error Codes
- **0**: Success
- **9**: Transaction confirmed  
- **6**: Transaction failed
- **99**: Unknown error (usually test environment issue)
- **11**: Duplicate order ID

### Debugging Tools
```bash
# Check server logs
node server.js

# Test MoMo directly
node test-simple-momo.js

# Test through our server
node test-momo.js
```
